# Theme Starter Template

## Description
This theme is a barebones theme, based off of the `_s` theme, that integrates Bootstrap 4.

I wouldn't put the theme on your site as is.  It doesn't really have any styling, but it is a great place to start as you develop your own custom theme.  

As my experience with this theme, Bootstrap, and Wordpress continues, this theme will undergo an evolution of both added features and the removal of redundancies.

## Setup

* Dependencies
  - Wordpress 4.7 or higher

* Installation
  - Download the zip, install in your local development environment, and develop away.

## Version

* 1.0
  - Added bootstrap language in theme template files.
  - Added bootstrap navbar functionality.
  - removed some redundant CSS from they main CSS file.
